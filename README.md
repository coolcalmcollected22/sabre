 Triage and Preview Toolkit

# About

"sabre" is collection of scripts and tools that I use for triage and on-site previews. There are currently 3 'versions'. One resides on any workstation and is meant to be run against USB drives and external drives plugged into the system (write blocker recommended). The next is meant to be run from a USB or SSD drive to be used on a live Windows system. The last one is a GUI only set of tools that can be used as a backup or by anyone familiar with the tools or less experience personnel.
