 Triage and Preview Toolkit

## About

"sabre" is collection of scripts and tools that I use for triage and on-site previews. There are currently 3 'versions'. One resides on any workstation and is meant to be run against USB drives and external drives plugged into the system (write blocker recommended). The next is meant to be run from a USB or SSD drive to be used on a live Windows system. The last one is a GUI only set of tools that can be used as a backup, by anyone familiar with the tools, or less experienced personnel.

## Installation

Meant to be simple and straight forward:
- Download the repo
- Add the desired folder to the desired location or drive
- Add the software listed in the folder(s) to the specific locations or add your own
- Runs the scripts or tools as desired.
